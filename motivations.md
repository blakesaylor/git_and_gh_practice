One of the biggest motivating factors for me changing my career is long term career potential. My background in Oil & Gas has been successful, educational, and a source of a lot of great friends, but the cyclical nature of the industry was a great source of stress for me. In the five years since I've been out of school, I've already seen two large downturns resulting in layoffs of lots of my coworkers due to things completely out of their control. Moving into a career in tech was of great interest to me due to the fact that even if one company may be struggling, many others exist that I could hop to and stay employed rather than having to weather a downturn and be unemployed.
